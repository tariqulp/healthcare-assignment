Typically, diagnostic research focuses on estimating the sensitivity and specificity of individual diagnostic tests, their predictive values, and other parameters of interest (such as likelihood ratios, ROC curves, test reliability). Accuracy measures are then used to generate posttest probabilities, given a set of pretest probabilities. This module will cover the basic principles behind diagnostic research, diagnostic study designs, sources of bias, and analysis and interpretation of diagnostic accuracy data.",
